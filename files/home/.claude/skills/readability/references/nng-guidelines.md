## Extracted principles

### 1) Write for scanning first

- Users scan before they read.
- Use chunking, headings, bullets, and selective emphasis.
- Put key information first (inverted pyramid).

### 2) Prioritize concision

- Shorter text improves comprehension and engagement.
- Remove fluff before formatting.
- Ask during editing:
  - Is this essential?
  - Can this be condensed?
  - Can this be simpler?

### 3) Format long content intentionally

NN/g highlights 5 practical formatting tactics for long-form pages:

- Summaries (top-of-page and optionally sectional)
- Bullet points
- Callouts
- Selective bold/highlight
- Informational visuals

Also:

- Use descriptive section labels (for example, `Summary` or `Key takeaways`).
- Keep highlighted text limited (NN/g suggests no more than ~30% of body text).
- Prefer informational images over decorative filler images.

### 4) Distinguish core quality layers

- **Legibility**: Can users physically see and recognize the text?
- **Readability**: Are words/sentences simple enough to parse quickly?
- **Comprehension**: Can users understand meaning and take the intended action?

### 5) Language guidance

- Prefer plain words and short sentences.
- Use active voice in most cases.
- Use user-familiar terms for the audience context.
- For broad consumer audiences, target lower reading levels (NN/g cites ~8th grade as a useful baseline).

### 6) Mobile amplifies readability problems

- Mobile viewport constraints reduce visible context.
- Keep copy even shorter and structurally explicit on mobile-heavy workflows.
