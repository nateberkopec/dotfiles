# readme-writer (legacy alias)

This skill is kept as a compatibility alias.

## Use these skills instead

1. `github-readme`
   - Project framing
   - Installation and quickstart flow
   - Usage examples
   - Contributing and license sections

2. `readability`
   - Concision
   - Scannability
   - Plain-language and comprehension checks
   - Automated readability guardrails

## Suggested order

1. Draft or revise the README with `github-readme`.
2. Polish wording and structure with `readability`.

If a user asks specifically for `readme-writer`, follow the same two-skill workflow above.
