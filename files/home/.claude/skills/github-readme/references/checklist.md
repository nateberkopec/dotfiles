# GitHub README checklist

Use this checklist after drafting a README.

## Must-have

- One clear H1 project title
- One-paragraph value proposition near the top
- Installation steps with runnable commands
- Quickstart or usage section with examples
- License section

## Should-have

- Features or capability list
- Configuration section for common options
- Contributing guidance (or link)
- Troubleshooting / FAQ for known friction points

## Anti-patterns to avoid

- Marketing-heavy intro with no quickstart
- Installation steps split across multiple distant sections
- Large walls of text without headings/lists
- Commands embedded in paragraphs instead of code blocks
- README that duplicates full docs instead of linking out
